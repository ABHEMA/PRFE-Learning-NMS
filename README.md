# Learning NMS with Machine Learning

This repository is part of a research and final apprenticeship project at EPITA. Its goal is to improve network management by applying machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and prediction. In this project, we combined multiple sources of network telemetry (SNMP polling, SNMP traps, and NetFlow) to create a unified dataset that is preprocessed, split, and converted into ARFF format for use with Weka. The project includes both data collection and processing scripts, as well as a detailed research paper explaining the network infrastructure setup and experimental methodology.

## Overview

This research project investigates the use of machine learning for intelligent network management. Traditional Network Management Systems (NMS) rely on fixed rules and threshold-based alerts, which can be insufficient for detecting subtle or evolving anomalies in modern, complex networks. Our approach leverages data from various sources—SNMP polling, SNMP traps, and NetFlow—to generate a comprehensive, annotated dataset. The dataset is then cleaned, segmented, and converted into a format compatible with Weka for training and evaluating multiple classification algorithms.

For detailed information on the network infrastructure setup, the configuration of the devices, and the specific usage of each script, please refer to the accompanying research paper linked to this GitHub project.
